# RTX_Tutorial
There is my, first attempt to create the RTX. There is no any API, just image.
P.S I'm studying from the book: Ray Tracing in One Weekend. It's my first steps.

# Building
You'd get the debug build from CMake running this command: 
```cmake
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

# Final result.
